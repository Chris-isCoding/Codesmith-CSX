				<h1>JS The Easier Parts - Variables, Data Types, and Control Flow</h1>
				<li>
					<h3>Challenge 1</h3>
					Replace the blank underscores inside the console logs with the data
					type (i.e. 'string') you think each value will be. (Leave the quotes)
					<br />
					Ex.
					<br />
					<pre>
  var myStr = "hello"
  console.log(typeof myStr === "string") //=&gt; true</pre
					>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Challenge 2</h3>

					Create a functon
					<code>buildSentence</code> that takes three words (strings) and adds
					them together and console.logs the whole sentence (string) complete
					with capitalization and punctuation.
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Challenge 3</h3>

					Create a function
					<code>lastLetter</code> that takes a word (string) and console.logs
					the last character/letter of that word. <br />
					Hint: Remember that each character/letter in a string has an index
					position that you can access with brackets: []
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Challenge 4</h3>

					Create a function
					<code>buildGreeting</code> that takes a time (integer) and a name
					(string) and print a greeting based on the following rules:
					<br />
					<ul>
						<li>
							If time is between 0 (inclusive) and 11 (inclusive): "Good
							Morning, &lt;<em>name</em>&gt;!
						</li>
						<li>
							If time is between 12 (inclusive) and 16 (inclusive): "Good
							Afternoon, &lt;<em>name</em>&gt;!
						</li>
						<li>
							If time is between 17 (inclusive) and 23 (inclusive): "Good
							Evening, &lt;<em>name</em>&gt;!
						</li>
						<li>
							If time is anything else: "That's not a real time,
							&lt;<em>name</em>&gt;. Maybe you need some sleep!
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Challenge 5</h3>

					<code>indexOf</code> is a function that you can call on a string
					(string1) and accepts another string (string2) as an argument. <br />
					It searches through string1 from left to right checking each character
					to see if it can find string2. <br />
					If it finds string2 it returns the index position of the FIRST
					character that matches string2. If it cannot find string2 it returns
					negative one: -1. <br />
					Enter the index position you think indexOf will return for each below.
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Challenge 6</h3>

					Create a function
					<code>letterExists</code> that takes a word (string) and a character
					(string), and console.logs whether that letter can be found inside
					that word.
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Challenge 7</h3>

					Create a function <code>isPrime</code> that console.logs a boolean
					indicating if `number` is prime or not.
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Challenge 8</h3>

					Create a function <code>range</code> that console.logs all numbers
					between 'start' and 'end' in sequential order.
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Challenge 9</h3>

					Create a function <code>myIndexOf</code> that takes an array and an
					element and console.logs the index of the element in the array, or -1
					if it doesn't exist.
					<br />
					Assume the `ele` will be a primitive data type (no arrays or objects).
					<br />
					DO NOT USE THE BUILT-IN `indexOf` METHOD IN YOUR SOLUTION!
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Challenge 10</h3>

					Create a function <code>unique</code> that console.logs an array where
					all the duplicates of the input array have been removed; in other
					words, every element remaining is unique.
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Challenge 11</h3>

					Create a function <code>longestWord</code> that that retuns the
					longest word of a sentence. <br />If there are ties, the function
					should return the later word.
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Challenge 12</h3>

					Create a function <code>disemvowel</code> that takes in a string and
					returns a string with all vowels removed.
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Challenge 13</h3>

					Create a function <code>divisibleByFivePairSum</code> that takes an
					array of numbers. <br />It should return an array of all the pairs of
					indices whose sum is a multiple of five.
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Challenge 14</h3>

					Create a function <code>highestScore</code> that takes in an array of
					student objects as a parameter.
					<br />
					<br />It should return a string that corresponds to the student with
					the highest score.
					<br />
					<br />The string should contain that student's initials concatenated
					with their id.
					<br />
					<br />Assume the array contains at least 1 student object and the
					student with the highest score is unique (there are no ties).
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Challenge 15</h3>

					Create a function <code>leastCommonMultiple</code> that takes two
					numbers (integers) as input and returns the lowest number which is a
					multiple of both inputs.
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Extension 1</h3>

					Create a function <code>arrayBuilder</code> that takes in a count
					object and returns an array filled with the appropriate numbers of
					elements. The order of the elements in the array does not matter, but
					repeated elements should be grouped.
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Extension 2</h3>

					Create a function <code>objectBuilder</code> that takes in a number
					and returns an object whose keys are 0 up to number and the values are
					that same number multipled by 5.
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Extension 3</h3>

					Create a function <code>secretCipher</code> that takes in an
					string(sentence) and an object(cipher). Return a string where every
					character is replaced with its cooresponding value in the cipher. If
					the character doesn't exist in the cipher, use the original character.
				</li>

				<li>
					<h3>Extension 4</h3>

					Create a function <code>passingStudents</code> that accepts an array
					of student objects. <br />It should iterate through the list of
					students and return an array of the names of all the students who have
					an average grade of at least 70.
				</li>
