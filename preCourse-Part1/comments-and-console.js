// Comments and the Console
// Comments and Console Logs
// Welcome to your first challenge! Don't worry, we'll ease you into it. We're going to go step by step through the basics throughout this entire pre-course unit. Don't stress out too much if it seems a little daunting at first.

// You'll be using the code editor to the right to work through the challenges provided while viewing the output of your code in the console window just below it.

// Unfortunately, much of what the computer does "under the hood" is invisible to us. This is where the console comes in! If we want the computer to show us what's going on, we can print, or log, directly to our console.

// Logging things to the console is a really handy way to see how JavaScript is interpreting values. We'll be using it frequently throughout the course, so you'll be a pro at it in no time. To use it, you need only type console.log() - whatever you pass between the parentheses (()) will be logged to the console.

// Notice that there are two forward slashes (//) before the console.log statement on line 2. These forward slashes create a comment. Comments are another really useful tool because they let us write little notes for ourselves or anyone else who's reading our code. Commented lines are ignored when the code runs, so they won't affect what happens when our code runs.

// Go ahead and run the code in the editor to the right by clicking the blue "Run Code" button. Nothing got printed to the console! The only thing we see is the console's note to us that it has finished executing code. How can we fix this?

// Let's give it a try, you got it! Then uncomment the console.log statement on line 2 by removing the forward slashes (//) at the beginning of the line. Now let's run the code again by clicking the blue Run Code button again. Now you should see "Hello World!" down in your console window.

// Challenge
// Now it's your turn! Go ahead and give it a try yourself! Create your own console.log below line 4. You can print any word or phrase you like to the console. Just make sure you put the word or phrase in between quotes ("") like the example. We'll go into detail very soon as to what that means.

// Try un-commenting the line below
console.log('Hello World!');

// ADD CODE BELOW HERE

console.log('this is a console.log in use');
