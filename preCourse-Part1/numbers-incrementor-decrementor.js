// Challenge: Numbers - Incrementor & Decrementor
// Incrementor / Decrementor
// As programmers, we are constantly updating data. By now you're probably getting pretty familiar with how to reassign the value of a variable, but here's an example to refresh your memory.

// let num = 7;

// num = num + 1;
// console.log(num); // => 8
// Notice how we use the syntax num = num + 1 to change the value of num. Wouldn't it be nice if we didn't have to type our variable name in twice? Luckily, in JavaScript, we have some really useful built-in operators to help us handle this redundancy. The first 2 we are going to cover are the incrementor (++) and the decrementor (--). Take a look at the example below:

// let num = 10;

// num++
// console.log(num) // => 11
// In the above example, just by using num++ we were able to increment the value of num by 1. Likewise, if we wanted to decrement the value by one, we could use num--. These operators are extremely useful, and you'll be using them quite a lot in Precourse - Part 2 when we dive into loops.

// Challenge
// 1. Using the incrementor operator, increase the value of num1 by 1.

// 2. Using the decrementor operator, decrease the value of num2 by 1.

// ========================== SOLUTION ======================================
// ================================================================================

let num1 = 32;
let num2 = 44;

// ADD CODE BELOW HERE
num1++;
num2--;

console.log(num1);
console.log(num2);
