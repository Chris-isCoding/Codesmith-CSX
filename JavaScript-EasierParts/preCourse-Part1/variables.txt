Variables & Constants What is a variable? Defining data and then manipulating
that data is the basis of programming. Without data, programming doesn't really
have a purpose. In JavaScript, we store this data inside variables. Essentially,
variables are just containers which hold reusable data. We do this using special
reserved keywords built into JavaScript. For changeable variables, we use var or
let, and for constant variables, we use const. let and const declarations come
with additional restrictions on how the variable can be used. Var JavaScript has
many different types of values. Some of these types are numbers, strings, and
booleans. Variables are used in order to store these values. In the code below,
the variable is named favoriteShow and the value that is being stored under the
name favoriteShow is currently "Shameless". var favoriteShow = "Shameless"; As
we mentioned above, the word var is a keyword in JavaScript that means we are
going to create a variable. This is followed by the variable name, then the
assignment operator (=) assigns whatever is to the right of the equals sign to
the variable name. Once you create a variable with the var keyword, you can also
update that variable's value. First, we create a variable called tvShow and
assign it the value "Black Mirror". Then, without using the var keyword we
reassign tvShow to equal "Parks and Recreation". var tvShow = "Black Mirror";
console.log(tvShow) // => "Black Mirror" tvShow = "Parks and Recreation";
console.log(tvShow) // => "Parks and Recreation" Notice the different outputs on
lines 2 and 4 each time we call console.log(tvShow). In the first one on line 2,
the output is "Black Mirror", but after we change the value of tvShow to "Parks
and Recreation" on line 3, we get a different output for our
console.log(tvShow). Why are we getting different outputs for the same exact
console.log? As you can see on line 3, we reassigned the value of tvShow from
"Black Mirror" to "Parks and Recreation." Once we change the value of a variable
to a new value, it will remain that value until it is changed again. Let & Const
let and const were introduced with the release of ECMAScript 2015, or more
commonly, ES6. You'll see this term quite a lot while you're learning JavaScrpt,
but for now, don't worry too much about it, it's just a version of JavaScript.
We'll go more into detail on what that means in a later lesson. In the example
below, you can see that the value of variables declared with the var and let
keywords may be reassigned. let fridge = "empty"; console.log(fridge) // =>
"empty" fridge = "full"; console.log(fridge) // => "full" var house = "dirty";
console.log(house) // => "dirty" house = "clean"; console.log(house) // =>
"clean" At this point you may be asking "what's the difference between let and
var?" This is a more advanced topic relating to how let and var (and const) are
scoped. You'll learn more about scope in later lessons. While using the var and
let keywords allows us to reassign a variable's value, const operates a bit
differently. The const keyword is used to create a constant. Now, while a const
declaration looks mainly the same as let and var variables, the value of a
constant cannot be changed throughout the code. Like let, const is also limited
to the scope in which it is declared. Consider the following: const pet = "cat";
pet = "dog"; // => TypeError: Assignment to constant variable. This would result
in the error "Assignment to constant variable" Knowing What to Use and When In
JavaScript today, it is considered best practice to avoid using var. You should
try and use let and const whenever possible. Just remember to use let when you
will be changing the value of the variable and const when you won't be changing
the value. Getting in the habit of using let and const properly now in the early
stages of your learning will help you keep your code easier to manage. 5 Rules
for Naming Variables and Constants There are a few things to know about naming
your variables and constants. 1. Variable names are case-sensitive. This means a
and A are two different variables, regardless which keyword (var, let or const)
that was used to define them. let a = "hello"; let A = "goodbye";
console.log(a); // => "hello" console.log(A); // => "goodbye" 2. Variable names
should begin with a lowercase character. 3. Variable names cannot begin with a
number. 4. Variable names cannot contain symbols. // VALID let user; let
applicant3; let favoriteCandy; // INVALID let 3applicant; let fav-candy 5.
camelCased variable names are best practice. camelCase is a naming convention in
which a name is formed by connecting multiple words together as a single word
with the first letter of each of the multiple words capitalized so that each
word that makes up the name can easily be read. The only word not caplitalized
is the first. // YES let favFood; let camelCasedVariable; let userName; // NO
let favoriterestaurant; let tobecompleted; Conslusion We've covered A LOT of
material here! Now we're going to spend the next 3 challenges practicing
declaring variables and constants. It may seem overwhelming right now, but don't
worry, we'll take it slow, and you'll be a pro in no time.
