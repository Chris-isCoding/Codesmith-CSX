// Challenge: Numbers - Assignment Operators
// Assignment Operator
// What if we wanted to increase our value by more than 1 though? Luckily, there's an operator for that as well! We call this an assignment operator.

// let num = 5;

// num += 10
// console.log(num) // => 15
// Here, we have the syntax of num += 10. This is the same thing as typing num = num + 10. By using the addition assignment operator (+=) we are able to add 10 to num similarly to how we did above with the incrementor/decrementor.

// The best part, is we aren't just limited to addition with the assignment operator. Each arithmetic operator has its own assignment operator:

// += - addition
// -= - subtraction
// *= - multiplication
// /= - division
// Challenge
// 1. Using the appropriate assignment operator, reassign the value of num1 to the current value plus 17.

// 2. Using the appropriate assignment operator, reassign the value of num2 to the current value minus 14.

// 3. Using the appropriate assignment operator, reassign the value of num3 to the current value times 11.

// 4. Using the appropriate assignment operator, reassign the value of num4 to the current value divided by 8.

// Utilize the console to test your code before you submit it!

// ========================== SOLUTION ======================================
// ================================================================================

let num1 = 32;
let num2 = 25;
let num3 = 92;
let num4 = 64;

// ADD CODE BELOW HERE

num1 += 17;
num2 -= 14;
num3 *= 11;
num4 /= 8;

console.log(num1);
console.log(num2);
console.log(num3);
console.log(num4);
