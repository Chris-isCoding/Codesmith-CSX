// Challenge: Strings
// Strings are a data type in JavaScript. In short, they are bits of text written inside of quotation marks. You can use either single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`) as quotation marks to wrap a string, as long as the opening and closing symbols match. They are particularly useful for any data or value that can be represented as plain text.

// Uncomment the text on lines 2 through 4 to see examples of strings.

// Challenge
// 1. On line 7, declare a variable mySingleString with single quotes ('), and set it's value to any string you like.

// 2. On line 8, declare a variable myDoubleString with double quotes ("'), and set it's value to any string you like.

// 3. On line 9, declare a variable myBackString with backticks (`), and set it's value to any string you like.

// Hint: For now, only use plain text without any special characters or contractions. We'll go into why these may cause you trouble in next challenge.

// You can uncomment lines 12-14 to test your code in the console.

// Uncomment the lines below to see examples of strings
console.log('A string can be written inside of single quotes.');
console.log('It can also be written inside of double quotes.');
console.log(`Backticks work, too.`);

// ADD CODE BELOW
let mySingleString = 'test';
let myDoubleString = 'double quotations marks';
let myBackString = `backticks`;

// Uncomment the line below to check your work!
console.log(mySingleString);
console.log(myDoubleString);
console.log(myBackString);
